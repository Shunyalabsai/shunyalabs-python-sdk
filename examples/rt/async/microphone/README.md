# Live Real-Time Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Shunyalabs Python SDK to transcribe audio from a microphone in real-time. It requires `pyaudio` to be installed for the example to work correctly.

The SDK requires an API key to be set as an environment variable before it can be used. You can obtain an API key by signing up for a Shunyalabs account at https://portal.Shunyalabs.com/dashboard

## Prerequisites

- Install Shunyalabs RT SDK: `pip install shunyalabs-rt`
- Export Shunyalabs API key: `export SHUNYALABS_API_KEY=YOUR-API-KEY`
- Install `pyaudio`: `pip install pyaudio`
